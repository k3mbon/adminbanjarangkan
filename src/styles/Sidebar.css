/* Legacy Sidebar.css - DEPRECATED
 * This file contains conflicting styles that override the design system.
 * All sidebar styles should be defined in DashboardLayout.css using design system variables.
 * This file is kept for reference but should not be used.
 */

/* 
 * CONFLICTS IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED:
 * - .sidebar class conflicts with DashboardLayout.css
 * - Hardcoded colors (#333, #fff, #555) override design system variables
 * - Generic 'a' and 'span' selectors cause global style pollution
 * 
 * MIGRATION NOTES:
 * - All sidebar functionality moved to DashboardLayout.css
 * - Uses CSS custom properties from design-system.css
 * - Follows WCAG accessibility standards
