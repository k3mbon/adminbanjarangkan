### 📚 Documentation Created

1. **`MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Complete step-by-step instructions
2. **`SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SETUP.md`** - Firebase credentials setup
3. **`MIGRATION_STATUS.md`** - This status report

### ⚙️ Configuration Updates

1. **`package.json`** - Added migration scripts:
   - `npm run migrate:export` - Export Firebase data
   - `npm run migrate:import` - Import to Sanity
   - `npm run migrate:full` - Complete migration

2. **`.env`** - Updated with Sanity configuration:
   - ✅ `VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=e0jvxihm`
   - ✅ `VITE_SANITY_DATASET=production`
   - ⚠️ `VITE_SANITY_TOKEN=` (needs user input)
   - ⚠️ `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN=` (needs user input)

3. **Dependencies** - Installed required packages:
   - ✅ `firebase` - Client SDK for data access
   - ✅ `firebase-admin` - Admin SDK for full access
   - ✅ `@sanity/client` - Sanity API client

## 🔄 Next Steps for User

To complete the migration, you need to:

### Step 1: Get Sanity Authentication Token

1. Go to [Sanity Manage Tokens](https://sanity.io/manage/personal/tokens)
2. Create a new token with **"Editor"** permissions
3. Copy the token
4. Update your `.env` file:
   ```env
   VITE_SANITY_TOKEN=your_token_here
   SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up Firebase Service Account (Optional)

For the most reliable export, follow `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SETUP.md` to:
1. Download Firebase service account key
2. Save as `serviceAccountKey.json` in project root

### Step 3: Run Migration

```bash
# Test setup first
node test-migration.js

# Run complete migration
npm run migrate:full

# Or run steps individually:
npm run migrate:export  # Export from Firebase
npm run migrate:import  # Import to Sanity
```

### Step 4: Verify Migration

1. **Check Sanity Studio**: Open http://localhost:3333/
2. **Check Application**: Open http://localhost:5173/
3. **Verify Data**: Compare document counts and content

## 📊 Migration Coverage

| Data Type | Status | Preserved Elements |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Blog Posts | ✅ Ready | Title, content, images, **original dates** |
| Prestasi | ✅ Ready | Achievements, categories, images |
| Albums | ✅ Ready | Photo collections, metadata |
| Carousel | ✅ Ready | Homepage images, order |
| Agenda | ✅ Ready | Events, dates, descriptions |
| Storage Assets | ✅ Ready | All images and files |
| Auth Users | ✅ Ready | User data (requires separate auth system) |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Authentication Handling

Since Sanity doesn't provide authentication services, user authentication will need to be handled separately. Options include:

1. **External Auth Services**: Auth0, Supabase Auth, Clerk
2. **Custom Auth**: Simple admin login system
3. **Full Migration**: Move to Supabase (Firebase alternative)

### Data Preservation

✅ **Original post dates are preserved** - Blog posts will maintain their original publication timestamps from Firebase.

### Security

- Service account keys contain sensitive credentials
- Don't commit `serviceAccountKey.json` to version control
- Delete service account file after migration
- Keep Sanity tokens secure

## 🆘 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Run diagnostics**: `node test-migration.js`
2. **Check logs**: Migration scripts provide detailed error messages
3. **Verify setup**: Ensure all environment variables are set
4. **Review guides**: See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` and `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SETUP.md`

## 🎉 Migration Benefits

After migration, you'll have:

- ✅ Modern headless CMS with Sanity
- ✅ Better content management interface
- ✅ Improved performance and scalability
- ✅ All original data preserved with timestamps
- ✅ Structured content with proper schemas
- ✅ Asset optimization and CDN delivery

The migration setup is complete and ready for execution!
